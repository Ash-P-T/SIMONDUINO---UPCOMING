This circuit, designed with guidance from Andre Lamothe in his Udemy course "Crash Course Electronics & PCB Design," It involved designing and implementing the hardware for the classic Simon game, which tests memory retention and pattern recognition through an interactive experience. The hardware was built around the ATMEGA328P microcontroller, leveraging its GPIOs for interfacing with LEDs, push buttons, and an audio amplifier to provide visual and auditory feedback.

Key components included the FT231XS-R chip for USB-to-UART communication, enabling seamless PC interfacing for programming and debugging. The design featured an efficient power supply system, including voltage regulation and decoupling capacitors, to ensure stable operation of all components. The LED indicators and switches were carefully integrated with priority encoders to minimize GPIO usage while maintaining functionality.

An audio amplifier circuit was designed to generate sound feedback, supporting PWM-based tones for an enhanced gaming experience. A custom circular PCB layout was created to reflect the game’s design aesthetics, optimizing the placement of LEDs, buttons, and other components for a user-friendly interface. This project demonstrated proficiency in hardware design, schematic creation, and PCB layout while emphasizing practical applications of embedded systems and circuit design principles.
